# Solidity metrics

This project is a static analysis based metric calculator tool for Solidity smart contract programs.
It is a **Work In Progress**, supporting the following metrics

| Parameter | Description                                                       | Data Type          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |

| FS        | The First time the smart contract has been Seen on the blockchain | Date               |

## Building the tool

You can build the tool with Maven to get an executable jar file:

```
mvn package
```

## Using the tool

Usage is very simple, the built jar is executable.
It requires two parameters:

1.  a Solidity file or a folder containing Solidity files
2.  an output csv file path.

```
java -jar solmet-0.1.jar [input(s)] [output]
```

## Output

The output is a comma separated file containing the values of the calculated metrics for each analyzed contracts/libraries/interfaces.

## Credits

The parser is based on the excellent antlr4 grammar available at https://github.com/solidityj/solidity-antlr4.
